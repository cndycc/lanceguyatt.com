## Technologies

### [`contentful`]

Manage content better with infrastructure.

### [`reactjs`]

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### [`gatsbyjs`]

Create blazing fast, compelling websites and apps without needing to become a performance expert.

### [`graphql`]

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

### [`styled-components`]

Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress

### [`amiga-workbench`]
Workbench 2.0 was released with the launch of the Amiga 3000 in 1990. Until AmigaOS 2.0 there was no unified look and feel design standard and application developers had to write their own widgets (both buttons and menus) if they wished to enhance the already-meager selection of standard basic widgets provided by Intuition.
